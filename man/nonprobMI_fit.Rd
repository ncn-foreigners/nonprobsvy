nonprobMI_fit: Function for outcome variable estimation based on nonprobability sample and using model based approach}
\usage{
nonprobMI_fit(
  outcome,
  data,
  weights,
  svydesign,
  family_outcome,
  control_outcome = controlOut(),
  start = NULL,
  verbose,
  model,
  x,
  y
)
}
\arguments{
\item{outcome}{- `formula`, the outcome equation.}

\item{data}{- an optional `data.frame` with data from the nonprobability sample.}

\item{weights}{- an optional `vector` of ‘prior weights’ to be used in the fitting process. Should be NULL or a numeric vector. It is assumed that this vector contains frequency or analytic weights}

\item{svydesign}{- an optional `svydesign` object (from the survey package) containing probability sample.}

\item{family_outcome}{- a `character` string describing the error distribution and link function to be used in the model. Default is "gaussian". Currently supports: gaussian with identity link, poisson and binomial.}

\item{control_outcome}{- a}

\item{start}{- a}

\item{verbose}{- a}

\item{model}{- a}

\item{x}{- a}

\item{y}{- a}
