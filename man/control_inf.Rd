\arguments{
\item{vars_selection}{If \code{TRUE}, then the variables selection model is used.}

\item{var_method}{the variance method.}

\item{rep_type}{the replication type for weights in the bootstrap method for variance estimation passed to \code{\link[survey:as.svrepdesign]{survey::as.svrepdesign()}}.
Default is \code{subbootstrap}.}

\item{bias_inf}{the inference method in the bias minimization.
\itemize{
\item if \code{union}, then the final model is fitted on the union of selected variables for selection and outcome models
\item if \code{div}, then the final model is fitted separately on division of selected variables into relevant ones for
selection and outcome model.
}}

\item{num_boot}{the number of iteration for bootstrap algorithms.}

\item{bias_correction}{if \code{TRUE}, then the bias minimization estimation used during model fitting.}

\item{alpha}{significance level, 0.05 by defult.}

\item{cores}{the number of cores in parallel computing.}

\item{keep_boot}{a logical value indicating whether statistics from bootstrap should be kept.
By default set to \code{TRUE}}

\item{nn_exact_se}{a logical value indicating whether to compute the exact
standard error estimate for \code{nn} or \code{pmm} estimator. The variance estimator for
estimation based on \code{nn} or \code{pmm} can be decomposed into three parts, with the
third computed using covariance between imputed values for units in
the probability sample using predictive matches from the non-probability sample.
In most situations this term is negligible and is very computationally
expensive so by default it is set to \code{FALSE}, but the recommended option is to
set this value to \code{TRUE} before submitting the final results.}

\item{pi_ij}{TODO, either a matrix or a \code{ppsmat} class object.}
}
\value{
List with selected parameters.
}
\description{
\code{control_inf} constructs a \code{list} with all necessary control parameters
for statistical inference.
