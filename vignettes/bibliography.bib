In this article, we study the asymptotic properties of the predictive mean matching estimator for finite-population inference using a superpopulation model framework. We also clarify conditions for its robustness. For variance estimation, the conventional bootstrap inference is invalid for matching estimators with a fixed number of matches due to the nonsmoothness nature of the matching estimator. We propose a new replication variance estimator, which is asymptotically valid. The key strategy is to construct replicates directly based on the linear terms of the martingale representation for the matching estimator, instead of individual records of variables. Simulation studies confirm that the proposed method provides valid inference.},

Design-based inference, in which the distribution for inference is generated by the random mechanism used by the sampler, cannot be used for nonprobability samples. One alternative is quasi-randomization in which pseudo-inclusion probabilities are estimated based on covariates available for samples and nonsample units. Another is superpopulation modeling for the analytic variables collected on the sample units in which the model is used to predict values for the nonsample units.

            Analysis of non-probability survey samples requires auxiliary information at the population level. Such information may also be obtained from an existing probability survey sample from the same finite population. Mass imputation has been used in practice for combining non-probability and probability survey samples and making inferences on the parameters of interest using the information collected only in the non-probability sample for the study variables. Under the assumption that the conditional mean function from the non-probability sample can be transported to the probability sample, we establish the consistency of the mass imputation estimator and derive its asymptotic variance formula. Variance estimators are developed using either linearization or bootstrap. Finite sample performances of the mass imputation estimator are investigated through simulation studies. We also address important practical issues of the method through the analysis of a real-world non-probability survey sample collected by the Pew Research Centre.},

In contrast to the existing the GMM estimation with a ﬁxed number of moments, we allow the number of moments to grow with the sample size and use optimal weighting. Hence, our estimator is eﬃcient, attaining the semiparametric eﬃciency bound derived in the literature. Existing semiparametric estimators estimate an eﬃcient score. However, this approach is either locally eﬃcient, or it suﬀers from the curse of dimensionality and the bandwidth selection problem. In contrast, our estimator does not suﬀer from these problems. Moreover, the proposed estimator and its consistent covariance matrix are easily computed using commercially available GMM packages. We propose two data-driven methods to select the number of moments. A small-scale simulation study reveals that the proposed estimator outperforms existing alternatives in ﬁnite samples.},

	abstract = {The propensity score plays a central role in a variety of causal inference settings. In particular, matching and weighting methods based on the estimated propensity score have become increasingly common in the analysis of observational data. Despite their popularity and theoretical appeal, the main practical difﬁculty of these methods is that the propensity score must be estimated. Researchers have found that slight misspeciﬁcation of the propensity score model can result in substantial bias of estimated treatment effects. We introduce covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS) methodology, which models treatment assignment while optimizing the covariate balance. The CBPS exploits the dual characteristics of the propensity score as a covariate balancing score and the conditional probability of treatment assignment. The estimation of the CBPS is done within the generalized method-of-moments or empirical likelihood framework. We ﬁnd that the CBPS dramatically improves the poor empirical performance of propensity score matching and weighting methods reported in the literature. We also show that the CBPS can be extended to other important settings, including the estimation of the generalized propensity score for non-binary treatments and the generalization of experimental estimates to a target population. Open source software is available for implementing the methods proposed.},

	abstract = {The probability-sampling-based framework has dominated survey research because it provides precise mathematical tools to assess sampling variability. However increasing costs and declining response rates are expanding the use of non-probability samples, particularly in general population settings, where samples of individuals pulled from web surveys are becoming increasingly cheap and easy to access. But non-probability samples are at risk for selection bias due to differential access, degrees of interest, and other factors. Calibration to known statistical totals in the population provide a means of potentially diminishing the effect of selection bias in non-probability samples. Here we show that model calibration using adaptive LASSO can yield a consistent estimator of a population total as long as a subset of the true predictors is included in the prediction model, thus allowing large numbers of possible covariates to be included without risk of overfitting. We show that the model calibration using adaptive LASSO provides improved estimation with respect to mean square error relative to standard competitors such as generalized regression (GREG) estimators when a large number of covariates are required to determine the true model, with effectively no loss in efficiency over GREG when smaller models will suffice. We also derive closed form variance estimators of population totals, and compare their behavior with bootstrap estimators. We conclude with a real world example using data from the National Health Interview Survey.},

Comparing the bias and root-mean-square error of ECLASSO with traditional calibration methods shows that ECLASSO can be a powerful method for adjusting non-probability surveys even when only a small sample is available from a probability survey.

	abstract = {Matching and weighting methods are widely used to estimate causal effects when needing to adjust for a set of observables. Matching is appealing for its nonparametric nature, but with continuous variables, is not guaranteed to remove bias. Weighting techniques choose weights on units to ensure that prespeciﬁed functions of the covariates have equal (weighted) means for the treated and control groups. This ensures an unbiased eﬀect estimate only when the potential outcomes are linear in those prespeciﬁed functions of the observables. Kernel balancing begins by assuming that the expectation of the nontreatment potential outcome, conditional on the covariates, falls in a large, ﬂexible space of functions associated with a kernel. It then constructs linear bases for this function space, and achieves approximate balance on these bases. A worst-case bound on the bias due to this approximation is given and minimized. Relative to current practice, kernel balancing oﬀers a reasonable solution to the long-standing question of which functions of the covariates investigators should balance. Furthermore, these weights are also those that would make the estimated multivariate density of covariates approximately the same for the treated and control groups, when the same choice of kernel is used to estimate those densities. The approach is fully automated, given the user’s choice of kernel and smoothing parameter, for which default options and guidelines are provided. An R package, kbal, implements this approach.},

Heuristically, our proposed procedure attempts to estimate a propensity score model by making the underlying covariate distribution of different treatment groups as close to each other as possible. Our estimators are data-driven and can be used to estimate different treatment effect parameters under different identifying assumptions, including unconfoundedness and local treatment effects. We derive the asymptotic properties of inverse probability weighted estimators for the average, distributional, and quantile treatment effects based on the proposed propensity score estimator and illustrate their finite sample performance via Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application.},

One such paradata is a respondent behavior, which can be used to construct response models. The propensity score weight using the respondent behavior information can be applied to the final analysis to reduce the nonresponse bias. However, including the surrogate variable in the propensity score weighting does not always guarantee the efficiency gain. We show that the surrogate variable is useful only when it is correlated with the study variable. Results from a limited simulation study confirm the finding. A real data application using the Korean Workplace Panel Survey data is also presented.},

In the second step, we focus on a doubly robust estimator of the ﬁnite population mean and re-estimate the nuisance model parameters by minimizing the asymptotic squared bias of the doubly robust estimator. This estimating strategy mitigates the possible ﬁrst-step selection error and renders the doubly robust estimator root n consistent if either the sampling probability or the outcome model is correctly speciﬁed.},

            Data integration combining a probability sample with another nonprobability sample is an emerging area of research in survey sampling. We consider the case when the study variable of interest is measured only in the nonprobability sample, but comparable auxiliary information is available for both data sources. We consider mass imputation for the probability sample using the nonprobability data as the training set for imputation. The parametric mass imputation is sensitive to parametric model assumptions. To develop improved and robust methods, we consider nonparametric mass imputation for data integration. In particular, we consider kernel smoothing for a low-dimensional covariate and generalized additive models for a relatively high-dimensional covariate for imputation. Asymptotic theories and variance estimation are developed. Simulation studies and real applications show the benefits of our proposed methods over parametric counterparts.},

The customary approach relies upon the specification of a single outcome regression model. In this note, we propose a novel predictive mean matching procedure that allows the user to specify multiple outcome regression models. The resulting estimator is multiply robust in the sense that it remains consistent if one of the specified outcome regression models is correctly specified. The results from a simulation study suggest that the proposed method performs well in terms of bias and efficiency.},
